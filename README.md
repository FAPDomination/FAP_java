(Title pending)

This game is about conquests and hexagons. The more tiles you own, the more points you get, and you can take other players' cells by standing on them for a while.
It also features special abilities and multiplayer up to 3 players on the same computer, for a maximum of 8 players including AIs.

## How do I play ?

The game is unfinished! It has a lot of ~~bugs~~ surprising features, is lacking graphics and music, the story mode is barely working. The day will come when this game is finished, but it is not this day. In the meantime, enjoy those screenshots of the unfinished game :

## I still want to play

If you really don't care about the game being unfinished, you can manually build it and launch it. Be aware that this is a test version.

```
build.sh
java -jar FapJava.jar
```
