This game is about conquests and hexagons. The more tiles you own, the more points you get, and you can take other players' cells by standing on them for a while.
It also features special abilities and multiplayer up to 3 players on the same computer, for a maximum of 8 players including AIs.

## How do I play ?

You don't. Sorry I haven't done any makefile for this game yet. But in the meantime, enjoy those screenshots of the unfinished game :

(If you really want to try it out, open an issue and ask for a makefile ;) )
